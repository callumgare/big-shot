# Big Shot
_A Vue-based image/video slide show widget._

Big Shot is a image and video full screen slide show Vue component.  It‚Äôs basically a loving rip-off of [PhotoSwipe](https://photoswipe.com/) but written from the ground up in Vue. That said it‚Äôs not aiming to replicate PhotoSwipe exactly. It will probably never have quite as many features or customisations as PhotoSwipe, at the same time it does things that PhotoSwipe doesn‚Äôt like natively support video.

## üé™ Demo
**Check out the [live demo](https://big-shot-demo.glitch.me/).**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Software Quality and Features
**Big Shot is very much in alpha.** No assurances are given, there are no tests yet and there could potentially be breaking changes in the future. So don‚Äôt use big shot in a situation when stability is very important.

### Things It Does
- Supports image and video
- Has the same zoom behaviour as PhotoSwipe (minus panning)
- Minimal and elegant UI
- Basic next/previous slide mobile swipe gesture
- Very basic plugins

### Things It Does Not Do (Yet?)
- Panning zoomed media
- Timer for automatic slide progression
- Captions/displaying other metadata 
- Events for slide changes
- HTML slides
- Rotation

I plan to slowly but continually improve Big Shot however I wouldn't rely on that. Unless you‚Äôre happy with how Big Shot functions at the moment I would recommend one of the other PhotoSwipe Vue implementations such as:
- [vue-picture-swipe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-picture-swipe) (whose readme also includes a good summary of other PhotoSwipe implementations for Vue).
- [vue-pswipe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-pswipe)

Pull requests are encouraged if you would like to contribute. Although for new features, unless you're happy to try your luck please create an issue before you write any code because I would like to build out Big Shot's feature set in a conscious and thoughtful way.

## üöÄ Getting Started
If the above hasn't scared you away give it a shot!

```bash
npm install big-shot
```
In your component script:
```javascript
import Vue from 'vue'
import BigShot from 'big-shot'

export default Vue.extend({
  name: 'MyComponent',
  components: { BigShot },
  data () {
    return {
      slideData: [
        { src: 'media/factory.jpg' },
        { src: 'media/sunset.jpg' },
        { src: 'media/santa.mp4', type: 'video' },
        { src: 'media/tree.jpg' },
        { src: 'media/tunnels.jpg' }
      ],
      showSlideShow: true
    }
  }
})
```

In your template add:
```html
<big-shot
  v-if="showSlideShow"
  :slideData="slideData"
  @exited="() => showSlideShow = false"
/>
```

**Important:** BigShot uses the Vue 2 backport of the composition API. Therefore it must be installed in the global vue instance for Big Shot to work. (Note step this is not needed if you are using Vue directly in the browser without compiling.)

First add the package:
```bash
npm install @vue/composition-api
```

Then the file which you initialise your app you must include:
```javascript
import VueCompositionApi from '@vue/composition-api';
Vue.use(VueCompositionApi);
```


## üéõ API
The props:
* **slideData**\
An array of objects, one for each slide you want to include. Currently the two property supported are:
  * **src**\
  The url to the media you want to include.
  * **type**\
  The type of media to display. Currently the two supported values are "image" (default) and "video".

* **rememberScale**\
This effects the initial [scale mode](#scale-modes) that a slide is displayed in. When a user toggles the scale mode of a slide, if it is toggled to the same mode as rememberScale is set to, then when a user changes slides that next slide will be initially displayed in that same scale mode. Currently only "contain" is supported.\
\
Setting rememberScale to "contain" has a side effect too. Normally "contain" mode is unavailable if showing the current slide in "contain" mode would make it larger than it's naturally dimensions (see [scales mode](#scale-modes)). However when rememberScale is set to "contain" the contain mode will always be available so a user will always be able to click a slide and toggle between the two scale modes.

* **beforeSlideChangeHook**\
As implied by the name this allows you to pass in a function which will be called when a slide change has been requested but before it occurs. This allows you to do things like load more slides or something if the user is approaching the end of the slide deck. If you give it an async function or return a promise it will block the slide change from occurring until the promise resolves. This function is called with an object ont\
  * **currentIndex**\
  The index of the current slide (this index starts at 0 not 1).
  
  * **newIndex**\
  This is what the index of the current slide will be after the slide change has taken place.

  * **delta**\
  The number of slides we're planning to change by. Ignoring "wrapping" for the moment, if delta is positive we're going forwards and if delta is negative then we're going back by delta number of slides. Be aware that delta might not equal newIndex - currentIndex. That is because the delta value is not "wrapped", meaning if you are currently on the last slide and go forwards 1 then the delta value will be 1 but since currentIndex + delta is greater than the index of the last slide the newIndex value is found by wrapping around to the other slide of the last of slides meaning that in this case the newIndex would be 0.

  * **length**\
  This is the number of slides.

* **plugins**\
An array of plugin objects. Currently there are two supported property for plugins:
  * **name** (required)\
  The url to the media you want to include.
  * **topbarIcon**\
  A component to be loaded into the topbar.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Behaviour
### Scale Modes
Slides can be shown in one of two scale modes, "natural" or "contain". In natural scale mode a slide will be shown with it's natural dimensions (ie no scaling to the slide will be done). "contain" will scale up or down a slide such that a slide is as big as possible without it being bigger than the current side of the view and thus cropped. By default the initial scale mode of a slide will be "natural" if the slide is smaller than it's viewport or "contain" if it's larger.A user can click on a slide to toggle scale modes as long as it is larger in "contain" mode is than it's "natural" size. If it's smaller only "natural" size will be available so as not to enlarge a slide such that it becomes blurry/pixelated.

## üåè Non-Vue Usage
Although Big Shot is written in the Vue framework you don't have to have a Vue-based app to use it. Check the [source code of the demo](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/big-shot-demo) to see see how it can easily be embedded in any webpage. (Although to be honest if you're not adding it to a Vue app I don't know why you wouldn't just use the original [PhotoSwipe library](https://photoswipe.com/).)


## ‚ú® Motivation
I wanted a photo and video slide show widget and after a bit of research I liked PhotoSwipe the best. There are a number of Vue wrappers for the PhotoSwipe library. These are mostly work fine but by the nature of being a wrapper around a library not originally designed as a Vue component they are always going to have certain limitations. So I decided to write my own and Big Shot was born.

The name is in part a nod to Cowboy Bebop and the eponymously named fictional tv show it featured.
